### Geography 371: Web Mapping
##### Description

A repository created for the final project of Geography:361 Web Mapping offered at Oregon State University. The project was to find an interactive web map to critique and present to the class. The map can be found at [Step Inside Japan](https://www.insideasiatours.com/step-inside/japan-location/CAoSLEFGMVFpcE1ZSG41SnZvNTJIU0M1ajFISlRwMGNOS2dFc0s0Ymx5QmFpejdE)

The objective of this map is to entice people to travel to Japan. It is part of a broader web map family that is called [Inside Asia Tours](https://www.insideasiatours.com/step-inside/japan) whose objective is to increase the tourism for a couple countries in Asia. They designed this map to be user friendly and show beautiful pictures of places within Japan. The target audience seems to be English speakers because the fact that the map text is in English. It also seems to be targeting people who can afford to travel and want to take beautiful pictures. I think its for a younger audience as well because the map imagery is more appropriate for a younger audience. I am pretty sure the map was created/served on the web in 2019. It was created by [Green Chameleon](https://www.craftedbygc.com/portfolio/step-inside-asia/) in for Inside Asia Tours.

The systematic architecture seems to be the same as most of the pages. There is the main webpage which has folders for animations (loading compass), images, and a folder for places. The html page is included in here as well. There are a bunch of plug-in websites that contain js and css files that work in tandem with the main html page.
